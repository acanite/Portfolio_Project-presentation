We have all been their, wanting to showcase our best projects to get that dream gig, but building websites for all those projects might not seem like a great idea.

Here's why:

Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating boiler plate site for smaller projects
So, what are you supposed to do?

Here comes git stats to the rescue. Working with you portfolio website, be able to insert amazing looking card lists showcasing your github repositories
